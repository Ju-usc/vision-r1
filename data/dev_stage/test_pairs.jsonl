Less fatty fish won’t release as much fat on their own, so you may need to add a splash more oil to the skillet if the skin isn’t getting crisp enough. Turn fish and cook just until opaque all the way through, about 1 minute.</step>\n    <step>3. Spoon green sauce onto a platter and carefully set fish, skin side up, on top.
